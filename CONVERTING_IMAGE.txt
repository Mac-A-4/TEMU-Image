If you want to use a different image than "original.png":

1. python3 convert.py <your_image.png/bmp/jpg> output.txt
2. Take the output in output.txt, and replace the width, size, and image inside of boot.s with it.
3. Recompile boot.s, and run.

*Larger images can exceed 512 byte limit. original.png is nearly at the limit, so anything smaller than it will work.
